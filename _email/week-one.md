GD2: Week One
=============

Hello there. I hope you're in the excitement of your first week of the fall 2020 semester and look forward to meeting you on Thursday üòÄ

The course web site has now been updated with details for the first two weeks of our semester: https://mica-web.github.io/gd-220/

Before our sync-up meeting on Thursday (more about that in a few), you can get a jump start by reviewing this list of initial tasks and things to read: https://mica-web.github.io/gd-220/00/early-start. Doing this will make sure you're sorted to start on Thursday.

This Thursday, there will be two 60-minute sessions for our sync up; you only need to attend one and can choose which session works for your schedule:
- Session 1
  - starting at 4:30pm Eastern (see in your time zone: https://everytimezone.com/s/383d204b)
  - Zoom link: https://mica-edu.zoom.us/j/93421359061?pwd=S2lKRnVsWGxrbUNIMys3bDZOb1llZz09
- Session 2
  - starting at 7:45pm Eastern (see in your time zone: https://everytimezone.com/s/71b83168)
  - Zoom link: https://mica-edu.zoom.us/j/93154070591?pwd=WGwwUVlzMHlXZFN5N3VxMjlKWlFPZz09

I will include a poll in the #gd2 channel in Slack to find out which session you'll be joining, and you can let me know via DM if neither of these times work for you.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the info I've shared so far, the course web site or my plans for Thursday. I'm happy to answer any of your questions via Slack üëçüèª

Again, I'm looking forward to Thursday and am excited to be your instructor for this course.

Cheers / Angelique

PS Per the course syllabus, this will likely be my last use of email and Canvas for communications. All future info will be shared via Slack and the course web site.
