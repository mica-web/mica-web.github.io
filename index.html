    <p>Prior to joining Panorama Education, I developed web sites as a freelancer, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.leftbankcreative.com/">Left Bank Creative</a>, and as a front-end lead for <a href="https://www.detroittrading.com/">Detroit Trading</a>, <a href="https://www.fracturedatlas.org">Fractured Atlas</a>, and <a href="https://lumenlearning.com/">Lumen Learning</a>. Before making the transition to tech, I worked at several art museums, including serving as the von Hess Graduate Fellow at the <a href="https://artbma.org/">Baltimore Museum of Art</a>. I received a BA in journalism from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where I attended the Cook Honors College, and also studied at Sheffield-Hallam University in the History of Art, Design and Film program and graduate studies in Museum Communication at University of the Arts.</p>
