  <h1 class="heading--underline">Greetings &amp; Salutations</h1>
  <p>I'm excited to be teaching at MICA and look forward to the opportunity to share this creative, challenging field with you.</p>
  <p id="js-point1">In addition to my role as an adjunct professor at MICA, I am also the senior UX engineer at <a href="https://www.fracturedatlas.org/">Fractured Atlas</a>, where I lead a small but mighty UX team crafting ever-better experiences for the artists and art organizations who use our products and the people who support them.</p>

    <p>Prior to joining Fractured Atlas, I developed web sites as a freelancer, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.leftbankcreative.com/">Left Bank Creative</a> and as senior front-end developer for <a href="https://www.detroittrading.com/">Detroit Trading</a>. Before making the transition to tech, I worked at several art museums, including serving as the von Hess Graduate Fellow at the <a href="https://artbma.org/">Baltimore Museum of Art</a>. I received a BA in journalism from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where I attended the Cook Honors College, and also studied at Sheffield-Hallam University in the History of Art, Design and Film program and graduate studies in Museum Communication at University of the Arts.</p>
