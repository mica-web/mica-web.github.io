### Homework

Class expectations were shared via Slack.

1. Upload your *project 4 designs* to the folder with your name in the shared Google Drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mfZs8UPw7TeRjPmMFie3_ItFCzcYVf-X?usp=sharing
    - Please share your design in a flat format (i.e., PNG, PDF, JPG) that is accessible to all
    - If you have multiple design options (not just one design at mobile and desktop), please *label* the design (i.e., Design A, Design B) to make it easier for folks to discuss.
    - Complete this *ASAP* in order to make step 2 smoother
2. You will review and critique *3 of your colleague's designs*:
    - I will message you via Slack to let you know _whose designs_ you should critique
    - Share your critique via this Google Form: https://forms.gle/kDGxXsHvYAUdSGECA
    - Complete this by *10pm Wednesday*
3. By *Thursday noon*, please share a sketch or wireframe that outlines your thinking about your markup _before_ you start coding. See here for an example of what this could look like: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvFKCa6iVP7aNGK3uYfSwMKFu4bbhDAIGMUaJAMSvdw/edit?usp=sharing
    - Also add this to the Google Drive folder for project 4; same request for flat formats as before!
    - The format that you do this in is totally up to you
    - The important thing is to convey the initial markup that you are considering for your design
    - Especially remember to use semantic HTML (avoiding `div`s where sensible) and thoughtful heading structure
