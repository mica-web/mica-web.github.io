### Activities

Check out the [Intro to HTML]({% link gd-220/html-intro.md %}).

### Homework

- Three <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/gd-220/html-intro.html#active-learning-exercises">HTML active learning exercises</a>. 
- Create a fourth CodePen using [this text](https://gist.github.com/angeliquejw/b3885856a671975033ea213c34b977fa) and add HTML using the elements you've learned so far.
    - Remember that you're focusing on the structure and meaning behind your HTML choices right now; the browser is going to apply some default formatting and, for now, you should just roll with it and not try to control the styling of your text.
    - If you have questions or doubts about any of your code, remember that you can leave me notes using [HTML comments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#HTML_comments). 

❗➡️ Please send me all four of your CodePen links by **11:59pm** on Monday, 2/4

Before our next meeting, read [Conversations with Robots: Voice, Smart Agents & the Case for Structured Content](https://alistapart.com/article/conversations-with-robots) and remember to bring your **questions**, **quotes**, and **comments/insights** from the reading to class.
