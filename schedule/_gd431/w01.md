### Homework

- Read about [content-first priority guides](https://alistapart.com/article/priority-guides-a-content-first-alternative-to-wireframes)
- Please bring your resume/CV in two formats:
  - printed out in its current format
  - digital in a text-only format (TextEdit in Mac, Notepad in PC)
    - you can use line breaks (pressing `enter` or `return`) to chunk your resume informatin, but should not format it (ie, no bold text, no font sizes, etc)
- Based on the reading, create a priority guide version of your resume. You can do this with pen and paper (must be legible!), a Google Doc, Sketch, Illustrator, InDesign, etc. If you choose one of the latter, remind yourself of the differences between **wireframes** and **priority guides** and make sure your result does not venture into wireframe territory!
