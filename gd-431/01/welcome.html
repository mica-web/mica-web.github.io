    <h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>

<p><span class="text-larger emoji">üëã</span> Welcome to Front End Web Development! Together, you‚Äôre going to sharpen the skills learned in GD2 and apply them to more complex and realistic projects.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>This class will be <span class="emoji">üíØ</span> online and mainly asynchronous ‚Äì which means you‚Äôll work through the course content and exercises on your own schedule on a weekly basis. We‚Äôll hold synchronous meetings to review your work, discuss readings, troubleshoot your code and anything else that feels valuable to do together synchronously.</p>

<p class="callout">To double down on what I wrote in the syllabus: <strong>This does <em>not</em> mean you‚Äôre on your own!</strong> You‚Äôll be connected to your colleagues and me via Slack, and I will provide a variety of opportunities to connect via Zoom.</p>

<p>Your weekly course materials will include the following sections</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>intro</b>: my overview of what we‚Äôre covering this week, why it matters and how it can help you</li>
  <li><b>sync up</b>: what we‚Äôll plan to do during our synchronous meeting</li>
  <li><b>activities</b>: what you should work on during the week (for example, readings, coding demos) and complete before the <em>next</em> class meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for example, the activities for this week ‚Äì week one ‚Äì should be completed before <em>next</em> Thursday and are <em>not</em> expected to be done before the first class meeting.</p>

<p>Even if the class does not meet in a given week, <span class="highlighter--simple">the activities should be completed on schedule</span> unless we explicitly discuss otherwise.</p>

<p class="callout">ü§î I know this might be a bit confusing. If there‚Äôs a way to make it clearer, let me know!</p>

<p>Within the pages I‚Äôve made in this course web site, I wanted to provide as much information as possible, but I realized sometimes it may confusing which instructions, links, readings, etc. are required and which are optional. I have tried to consistently use this <span class="emoji" title="Following and reading this link is optional."><span class="u-sr-only">Following and reading this link is optional.</span>‚ú≥Ô∏è</span>
 asterisk emoji to identify links or materials that are <strong>optional</strong>.</p>

<p class="callout">This, however, does rely on me remembering to add in the emoji, so if you‚Äôre ever in doubt, feel free to ask in Slack if I expect you to read a particular link!</p>

<h2 id="week-one-details">Week one details</h2>
<p>This week, we have two priorities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have a shared understanding of the goals of this course, discuss the format of the course, and make sure you know what it takes to be successful in the course.</li>
  <li>Get you sorted with the tools we‚Äôll use throughout the semester.</li>
</ol>

<p>Week one is going to start off with some pretty solid technical challenges ‚Äì but know that I‚Äôve guided several classes through this in the past and we‚Äôve always been able to troubleshoot any issues that have come up. Also, the tools you‚Äôre being introduced to are ones you‚Äôll use for every project this semester ‚Äì so, what might feel challenging or confusing in week one will be routine by week 16 (and even earlier).</p>
