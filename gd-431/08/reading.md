**Purpose:** In advance of your redesign comps, broaden your understanding of one area of importance related to web design.

There are two possible readings this week:
- One explains a systematic way to create color palettes for your web projects.
- The other describes the building blocks of web sites and how things come together to create patterns, pages and user flows through an entire site.

You should reflect on which of these subjects would be most beneficial to you -- which do you have the least amount of experience with? Based on your self evaluation, select the appropriate reading below:

- [Building Your Color Palette](https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/) {% include estimate.html time=6 %}
- [The Building Blocks of Interfaces: Objects → Components → Patterns → Pages → Flows](https://bbuis.org/chapters/02-the-building-blocks-of-interfaces/#section-2-objects--components--patterns--pages--flows) {% include estimate.html time=7 %}

{: .callout }
The reading for **The Building Blocks of Interfaces** is _only_ for Section 2. Please note that there are 5 sections on this page, and you are not expected to read all of them.
