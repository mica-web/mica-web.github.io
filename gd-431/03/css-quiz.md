## In Brief
This is a short quiz to establish what you remember or know of CSS.

## Purpose
Just like last week's debugging HTML exercise, this quiz is meant to help you and I both evaluate what familiarity with CSS you've retained from previous classes. Based on how you do on this quiz, you may want to do the additional readings and activities under "Next Steps" below.

<!-- CSS Review 1 -->
{% include quiz.html
  title="Share What You Know"
  quizId="6VT5TMY"
  hint="While this quiz has right and wrong answers, your score will not affect your grade; this is for participation points only."
%}

## Next Steps
If this activity made you want to review some CSS, I highly recommend these lessons from the tutorial <cite>HTML & CSS Is Hard (but it doesnâ€™t have to be)</cite> by Oliver James.

There are instructions to follow along with for each of these, and I've created a [Glitch project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mica-css-review-1) for you to remix and use for this purpose.

- [Hello, CSS](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/hello-css/){% include estimate.html time=19 %}
- [CSS Box Model](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/){% include estimate.html time=20 %}
- [CSS Selectors](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-selectors/){% include estimate.html time=24 %}

These activities are optional, but if you complete them and want to get feedback on your work, you can share your Glitch project with me:

<!-- CSS Review 2 -->
