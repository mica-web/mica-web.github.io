Site evaluation heuristics
==========================

Before you start
----------------
- What is the user goal for this web site? You shouldn't try to cover all the bases here; just identify the top 1-2 use cases and motivations for users.
- What is the business goal for this web site?
- Who is the target audience for this site? 


Homepage
--------
- Is the homepage focused on a user's expectations and key tasks?
- Does the homepage content include irrelevant information or does it fall prey to info dumping?


Interior pages
--------------
- Are section titles clear and descriptive?
- On interior pages, do users still understand "where" they are in the site?


Navigation/Organization
-----------------------
- Is site navigation clear? Do you easily understand what you will see before you click a link?
- Is the site navigation organized logically?
- Can a user easily return to the previous page? to the homepage?
- Are the site's standard elements (e.g., page titles, site navigation, page navigation) easy to locate?
- As a user, can you easily discover new and relevant information without frustration?


Search
------
- Does the site have a search input? 
- Do the search results include the information most relevant to a user?


Aesthetics/Visuals
------------------
- Are the colors and typography consistent? When the design is not consistent, are the distinctions meaningful?
- Does the interface have an attractive design? Is it appropriate to its audience?- Is the site imagery (e.g., photos) meaningful?
- Are icons intuitive and/or labeled?
- Do the icons look like they belong to a family of icons?
- Is there is a good balance between information density and use of white space?
- Are animations used sparingly and to good effect?
- Are there any places in the design where color is used to communicate something (e.g., success, a warning)? Is there a secondary cue to convey that same info to users who may be colorblind?
- Is there a clear visual hierarchy?
- Is the texts easily readable?
  - Consider font size, [contrast ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/), whitespace

- Is there a visual change when a user points their mouse at something clickable?
- Are clickable elements at least 44x44 px on touchscreen devices?
- Is there helpful feedback on action items (e.g., notifications when something is saved, added to your cart, system notifications, etc.)?


Credibility
-----------
- What trust indicators exist on the site?
  - How can they be improved?

- Is the site responsive?
  - If yes, what could be improved?
- Are there common characteristics and wording in the site's navigation, prompts and layout?
