## In Brief
The following HTML example has several errors in it. <b>Remix</b> this project on Glitch and do your best to improve this code.

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/debugging-html?path=index.html&previewSize=0&sidebarCollapsed=true"
    title="debugging-html on Glitch"
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; encrypted-media"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

## Purpose
This is an evaluation exercise that will give you a sense of what familiarity with HTML you've retained from previous classes. You'll be asked to complete an activity and also evaluate yourself, so you know whether or not to do additional HTML review.

## Process
This is meant to be a **short** exercise; [set a timer](https://timer.onlineclock.net/timers/20minutes/){:target="_blank"} and don't spend more than 20 minutes on this please. <span class="emoji">üôèüèª</span>

{: .callout }
The timer is not meant to make you anxious, but rather to stop you from spending _too_ much time on this activity. It's a _much_ better use of your time to read the review links below than to spend an hour on this activity.

1. Click the <b>Remix to Edit</b> button to make a copy of this Glitch project.
1. Next, click <b>Edit Fullscreen</b>; this will force the project to open in its own window where you can save your work. **You must do this in order to have a copy of your changes to share back with me.**
1. Make changes to the `index.html`, focusing first on any code that is broken.
1. After you've fixed the areas with broken code, review the HTML to see if there are other improvements to be made.
1. When you are satisfied with your code, copy the link for your project and add it to the form immediately below. See this screen capture to see how to get the link:

![Click the Share button and then the Code button. Copy the URL that reveals.]({{ ip | append: 'glitch-share.gif' }})
