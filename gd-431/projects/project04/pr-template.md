# Project 4 {{page.title }}

Before submitting your PR, please do the following:

1. Update your PR title (it often defaults to one of your commit messages)
1. Add a link to your corresponding project on Glitch in the description.
1. Choose one of the following options:
  - I want detailed feedback on my GitHub PR (this option is similar to how I have graded your previous projects)
  - I do not require comments on GitHub, just a grade (selecting this option, you will get a grading rubric sheet, but no comments on GitHub)

If you would benefit from comments on GitHub, I'm happy to provide them. Your choice here will _not_ affect how I grade your final project.

Additionally, please add the following questions and your responses to your PR description.

1. If you had another week or two to work on this project, what else would you do?
1. Describe which aspect of this project you found most confusing or frustrating.
1. Share what about this project you are most proud of.
1. What is the most beneficial thing you've learned in this course?

The answers to each question should be ~50-200 words long (or, more simply, **not an essay but also not a 3-word response**) and will be factored into the professionalism section of the grading rubric.

Finally, include a short (1-2 sentence) response to these questions:
- Summarize the project requirements and evaluate if you have met them.
- Did you review the best practices checklists for [HTML]({% link _learn/01_HTML/best-practices.md %}) and [CSS]({% link _learn/02_CSS/best-practices.md %}) to check your own work on this project?

You can copy the questions from [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/angeliquejw/0e42473a7a94fcb1890f5f53be8ec9c8/raw/4c26e9d0159d7388ee473ccab838e5cb1869d54d/gd431-p4-pr-template.md){:target="_blank"} and paste them into your PR description.
