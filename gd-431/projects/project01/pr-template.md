Before submitting your PR, please add the following questions and your responses to your PR description.

1. Summarize at least 2 benefits of using priority guides in a web design process.
1. List the ways in which the organization of this version of your resume differs from your initial resume.
1. Describe which aspect of this project you found most confusing or frustrating.
1. Share what about this project you are most proud of.

The answers to each question should be ~50-200 words long (or, more simply, **not an essay but also not a 3-word response**) and will be factored into the professionalism section of the grading rubric.

Finally, include a short (1-2 sentence) response to this:
- Did you review the best practices checklists for [HTML]({% link _learn/01_HTML/best-practices.md %}) and [CSS]({% link _learn/02_CSS/best-practices.md %}) to check your own work on this project?

You can copy the questions from [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/angeliquejw/cffa95fe311f871d55795b146b3b2a0a/raw/02e7c9b7561e1cea071db793071e2fd6b32ce915/gd431-p1-pr-template.md){:target="_blank"} and paste them into your PR description.
