1. You will use the project and repo you created when completing the [instructions to connect Glitch and GitHub]({% link _learn/03_workflows/glitch-and-github.md %}).
1. Before starting to write any HTML, you must first [create a branch]({% link _learn/03_workflows/branching.md %}) off the master branch. Name your new branch <b>resume</b>.
1. After you've created your new branch and are working on the <b>resume</b> branch, add a new file named <b>index.html</b>
1. Open the new <b>index.html</b> and, in your text editor, type an exclamation mark `!` and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
  - This shortcut should create the default structure for your HTML document.
  - If, for whatever reason, this does not work for you, you can instead copy the HTML from [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/angeliquejw/cf4f8dec09092103c0b7a75daa75a7a0/raw/a94fec4a8c121ffd2d65cd3a0fcef1bec25c7f44/index.html){:target="_blank"} and paste it into your `index.html` file.
1. After you've saved your `index.html`, stage your changes and make a commit (example commit message: "Created HTML document.")
1. Push your changes up to GitHub; you should now see a matching copy of the `index.html` in your GitHub repo and on the Glitch project page.
