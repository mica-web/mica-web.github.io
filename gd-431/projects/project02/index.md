# {{page.title }}: Dynamic Poster

## In Brief
Use your current knowledge of HTML and CSS layout to reinterpret an existing poster design as a responsive web page.

## Purpose
- Adapt and interpret an existing print design into responsive code
- Practice and stretch your current CSS skills
</header>

<section>

## Research
1. Search for posters to emulate in code and make responsive.
  - Focus on posters that are predominantly **text** and **shapes**
  - Some imagery is fine, but less or none is better
  - While you are free to use examples from any source, I have also provides some [example poster sources here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link gd-431/projects/project02/posters.md %})
1. Identify four possibilities:
  - three possibilities of interesting designs to recreate
  - plus one "stretch" example
1. Document your ideas using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nQntSNZqwUeqfX8uHrNkrMNwEdKMtvcJ18cK0ehK9z8/copy?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
  - Due date: 10/01 by 9am EST ([see in your timezone](https://everytimezone.com/s/5c5adb0f){:target="_blank"})
  - Format: Google Doc
  - File name: **Please** use your first initial and last name (for example: `aweger`)
  - How to submit: Add your file to the **poster-ideas** folder inside our  {% include gd431-drive.md %}
1. I will review all ideas and discuss them, providing guidance on your final selection of a design to recreate.

## Process
1. Write markup to semantically represent the poster content.
1. Crop or recreate elements of imagery as needed.
1. Write mobile-first CSS.
1. Add media queries to achieve desktop design.
1. Present project to colleagues.

## Submission
1. Create a [pull request]({% link _learn/03_workflows/pull-request.md %}) for code review and final submission.
  - Include [PR template questions]({% link gd-431/projects/project02/pr-template.md %}) and your responses.
1. Send me a link to the pull request via Slack DM by midnight EST on 10/16 ([see in your timezone](https://everytimezone.com/s/1f14f2eb){:target="_blank"}).


## Requirements
- Your final design should be closely inspired by the original poster, including color, type, etc.
- The design should be responsive, working on mobile devices as small as 480px wide and other devices up to 1280px wide.
