# Project 2 {{page.title }}

Before submitting your PR, please update its title (it often defaults to one of your commit messages) and, in the description, include the link to your corresponding project on Glitch.

Additionally, please add the following questions and your responses to your PR description.

1. How did you approach making the poster you selected responsive from mobile to desktop sizes? Do you think you were successful?
1. Explain a benefit of using Sass you encountered while working on this project.
1. Describe which aspect of this project you found most confusing or frustrating.
1. Share what about this project you are most proud of.

The answers to each question should be ~50-200 words long (or, more simply, **not an essay but also not a 3-word response**) and will be factored into the professionalism section of the grading rubric.

Finally, include a short (1-2 sentence) response to these questions:
-  Summarize the project requirements and evaluate if you have met them.
- Did you review the best practices checklists for [HTML]({% link _learn/01_HTML/best-practices.md %}) and [CSS]({% link _learn/02_CSS/best-practices.md %}) to check your own work on this project?

You can copy the questions from [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/angeliquejw/ed9cffd423beb62f344f7cae175e40d5/raw/2c5702535436921226e7f1a71a15a9da453f1df2/gd431-p2-pr-template.md){:target="_blank"} and paste them into your PR description.
