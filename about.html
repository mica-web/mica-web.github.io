<p class="heading xl">Greetings &amp; Salutations!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I'm excited to be teaching Front End Web Development and look forward to the opportunity to share this creative, challenging field with you.</p>

    <p>In addition to my role as an adjunct professor at MICA, I am also the senior UX engineer at Fractured Atlas, where I lead a small but mighty UX team crafting ever-better experiences for the artists and art organizations who use our products and the people who support them.</p>

    <p>Prior to joining Fractured Atlas, I developed web sites as a freelancer, in collaboration with Left Bank Creative and as senior front-end developer for Detroit Trading. Before making the transition to tech, I worked at several art museums, including serving as the von Hess Graduate Fellow at the Baltimore Museum of Art. I received a BA in journalism from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where I attended the Cook Honors College, and also studied at Sheffield-Hallam University in the History of Art, Design and Film program and graduate studies in Museum Communication at University of the Arts.</p>
