<h1 id="intro-to-sass">Intro to Sass</h1>

<p>Sass is a stylesheet language that is informed by the CSS you already know how to write and is compiled into CSS for use in your projects and for browsers to interpret.</p>

<p class="callout"><b>Compiled</b> is just a tech way of saying converted. So, in this case, your Sass file is converted into a CSS file.</p>

<p>Writing Sass gives you access to a wide variety of features and benefits that are not possible writing standard CSS. The tagline on the <a href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass homepage</a><span class="emoji text-smaller" title="Following and reading this link is optional."><span class="u-sr-only">Following and reading this link is optional.</span>✳️</span>
 is “CSS with superpowers” and that’s exactly what Sass delivers. <span class="emoji">💥</span></p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/sTagKs58YUj1S/giphy.gif" alt="A young girl has a lotta sass and the other members of her dance troupe cannot keep up." /></p>

<h2 id="superpowers">Superpowers</h2>
<p>What are some specific superpowers you gain by writing Sass?</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>Using Sass, you can create <b>variables</b> to use throughout your stylesheets.</p>

<p class="callout">Variables are a common feature in most programming languages (though they may <em>look</em> different from language to language) and help you writer simpler, more consistent code.</p>

<p class="text-push--bottom"><span class="emoji">👉🏻</span> <a href="/learn/css/sass-variables">Learn how to create and use variables</a></p>

<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>Sass includes several built-in functions for modifying colors, including lightening, darkening, mixing, inverting.</p>

<p class="text-push--bottom"><span class="emoji">👉🏻</span> <a href="/learn/css/sass-functions">Explore Sass functions</a></p>

<h3 id="nesting">Nesting</h3>
<p>Writing Sass allows you to write less code, since you can nest your selectors inside of each other.</p>

<p class="text-push--bottom"><span class="emoji">👉🏻</span> <a href="/learn/css/sass-nesting">Learn how to nest your selectors</a></p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Sass has two different syntaxes – two different ways of writing your Sass – and they are differentiated by their file extensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example.scss</code> – This looks <em>almost</em> exactly like CSS and, in fact, any existing CSS can be imported into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.scss</code> file and just work. <span class="emoji">🎉</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example.sass</code> – This was the original syntax and doesn’t look much like the CSS you’re used to, since it doesn’t use curly brackets (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code>) or semicolons (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code>). This syntax has strict rules about whitespace and indentation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All of the Sass shared as examples in this class will use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.scss</code> syntax, and this is also the syntax you should use for your projects.</strong></p>

<p class="callout">Even though we’re using just the one syntax, it’s important to know that the other one exists when you’re looking at other folks’ Sass examples. You cannot import a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sass</code> example into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.scss</code> file and have it work.</p>

<h3 id="sass-comments">Sass comments</h3>
<p>There are also two ways of writing comments in Sass. If you write standard CSS comments, they will appear as expected in your compiled CSS file. Alternately, you can write Sass comments that will <em>not</em> be compiled. Here’s an example of both comment types in a Sass file:</p>

<div class="language-scss highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">/* This is a typical CSS comment you're used to */</span>

<span class="c1">// This is a new Sass-style comment</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this is how it would output as CSS:</p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">/* This is a typical CSS comment you're used to */</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second style of comment would <em>not</em> appear in your final CSS document, only in the Sass files.</p>

<p>In general, it’s fine to use either style of comments. Using CSS-style comments <strong>will</strong> result in a larger CSS file, but it is unlikely that you will be writing so many comments for this to have a measurable impact.</p>

<h2 id="preprocessors">Preprocessors</h2>
<p>As noted at the start of this page, Sass <em>isn’t</em> CSS, but your Sass file gets compiled into CSS for use in your projects. This makes Sass an extension of CSS and this type of extension is known as a <b>preprocessor</b>.</p>

<p>The processing of Sass into CSS will happen automatically with the <a href="https://glitch.com/~mica-sass-starter">Sass project template</a> you’ll be remixing on Glitch, but it’s worth noting that this is hiding away some of the complexity of using Sass.</p>

<p class="callout">The following is <strong>not needed</strong> for your projects this semester, but is provided as additional context if you want to use Sass in other, future projects.</p>

<p>If you want to use Sass on a project that is <em>not</em> using Glitch, you’ll have to do some additional reading about <a href="https://sass-lang.com/install">installing and using Sass</a><span class="emoji text-smaller" title="Following and reading this link is optional."><span class="u-sr-only">Following and reading this link is optional.</span>✳️</span>
. You can do this via the command line or by using an application (<a href="https://prepros.io/">Prepros</a><span class="emoji text-smaller" title="Following and reading this link is optional."><span class="u-sr-only">Following and reading this link is optional.</span>✳️</span>
 works on all operating systems and is one I used in the past).</p>
