# What did you most value about your faculty member?

She was always so available and put students first in the class

She was also very responsive to questions via slack and answered and helped very quickly.

The time spent going over code individually, and her ability to give great feedback in and outside of the classroom as well as her insight on industry experience.

I love that she devotes a lot of time to each student's issues and sends you resources specific to your project.

She is very approachable and knowledgeable about the subject and is willing to spend one-on-one time to help her students.

I liked her willingness to help people individually.

Her willingness to help with whatever we needed to understand coding better outside and inside class.

She helped students as much as she could, even after the class is over.

Angelique was very approachable and very easy to contact over slack. I could tell that she cared about our learning, she would have one on one help with any part of our code that we had difficulty with.
