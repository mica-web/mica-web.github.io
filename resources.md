## Learning online
Real talk: Taking classes online isn't without its challenges. For many of you, this is a new and unexpected format. Having said that, you can adapt to these circumstances by thinking about what those challenges might be for you up front and developing strategies to handle them. See [my recommendations for successful online learning](learning-online).

## Places to keep up with front-end web dev
These two sites have a wealth of knowledge and articles across the spectrum of front-end web development.

### Email newsletters
While I wouldn't recommend signing up for each of these -- information overwhelm <span class="emoji">ðŸ™€</span> -- consider adding 2 to your email inbox. I find email newsletters to be a nice, bite-size way to keep learning about web development.
