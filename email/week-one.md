GD2: Week One
=============

Hello there. I hope you're in the excitement of your first week of the fall 2020 semester and look forward to meeting you on Thursday ðŸ˜€

The course web site has now been updated with details for the first two weeks of our semester: https://mica-web.github.io/gd-220/

Before our sync-up meeting on Thursday (more about that in a few), you can get a jump start by reviewing this list of initial tasks and things to review: https://mica-web.github.io/gd-220/00/early-start. Doing this will make sure you're sorted to start on Thursday.

On Thursday, there will be two 60-minute sessions for our sync-up; you only need to attend one and can choose which one works for your schedule:
- Session 1
  - starting at 4:30pm Eastern (see in your time zone: https://everytimezone.com/s/383d204b)
  - Google Cal invite: https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MXRzZTViajJzam1rMW50OWg4dDFwaWs5bm4gY18zNGNwcXU0OGFmY3Rmc28xdGY2OWVpbjdjZ0Bn&tmsrc=c_34cpqu48afctfso1tf69ein7cg%40group.calendar.google.com
  - Zoom link: https://mica-edu.zoom.us/j/93421359061?pwd=S2lKRnVsWGxrbUNIMys3bDZOb1llZz09
- Session 2
  - starting at 7:45pm Eastern (see in your time zone: https://everytimezone.com/s/71b83168)
  - Google Cal invite: https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=M3N0bjRjdXE5Ymx2ODdpNjAyYm81Y25oZTEgY18zNGNwcXU0OGFmY3Rmc28xdGY2OWVpbjdjZ0Bn&tmsrc=c_34cpqu48afctfso1tf69ein7cg%40group.calendar.google.com
  - Zoom link: https://mica-edu.zoom.us/j/93154070591?pwd=WGwwUVlzMHlXZFN5N3VxMjlKWlFPZz09

I will include a poll in the #GD2 channel in Slack to find out which session you'll be joining, and you can DM me if neither of these times work for you.
