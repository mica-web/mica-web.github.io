Welcome to GD2
==============

Hi there! üëãüèª

This is a very early welcome to my fall 2020 GD2 course. As you might imagine, there's still a lot that I'm sorting out, but I wanted to introduce myself as early as possible, provide some initial information about the course and give you a way to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.

My name is Angelique Weger, I'm a professional web developer and have been teaching web design and development at MICA since 2018. While this is my first time teaching this material online, as you might imagine for a coder, I already interact online a lot and have been working remotely for over a decade. I am very confident in my ability not only to help you build the skills promised in this course, but also to navigate the course and our interactions online.

Much of the information for this course will be shared via Slack and I invite you to join the Slack now, if you want:
- Join with your mica.edu address: https://mica-web.slack.com/join/signup#/
- Join using a different email address: https://bit.ly/join-mica-web

If you're new to using Slack, no worries! The welcome message after you join will link you to some info about using Slack. üëçüèª

Other than Slack, another big resource for the course will be the course web site, which you can view here: https://mica-web.github.io/gd-220/ As noted on the site, the info is in the process of being updated for the upcoming semester, but it will give you some insight into what the course has looked like in the past.

Once you're in Slack, feel free to contact me with any questions you might have. I expect 95% of my answers may be "I'm still figuring that out," but I'm interested in hearing what concerns you might be having.

Okay, that was a lot of info. And, honestly, I failed to say the most important thing: I am very excited to meet you and to work with you this semester. I honestly love teaching this course and consider it a privilege to introduce you to the world of designing and coding for the web. ‚ú®

I'll be in touch the week of August 31 with more information and hope to see you in Slack soon!
