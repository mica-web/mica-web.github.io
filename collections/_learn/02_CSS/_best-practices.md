- CSS is lowercase
- Declarations within each ruleset are ordered alphabetically by property name
- A semicolon ends each declaration
- Comments are used to break up sections and explain your code
- `box-sizing` is declared
- All floats are properly cleared
- Selectors are either bare elements or classnames (IDs are avoided)
- Classnames are helpful and written kebab-style (i.e., using hyphens)
- CSS does _not_ reiterate browser defaults
- CSS is not written in such a way that it is immediately overwritten by other declarations
- Color values are used logically and consistently (e.g., hex and hsl values aren't mixed)
- Units are used logically and consistently
- Zero measurements do _not_ include units
- CSS is error free
