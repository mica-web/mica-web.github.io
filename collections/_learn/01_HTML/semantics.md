When writing HTML, you should always be thinking about the function or purpose of your content and how it relates to other bits on the page.

So far, you've learned the following HTML elements:
- headings (e.g., `h1`, `h2`)
- the paragraph element (`p`)
- the anchor element (`a`), more commonly known as a link
- the `strong` element, which is used to indicate that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency
- the `img` element for embedding images

If you wanted to add some song lyrics to a web page, you wouldn't use the `img` element because that's not meant for text. This tells you that HTML elements have meaning and provide meaning to your content.
