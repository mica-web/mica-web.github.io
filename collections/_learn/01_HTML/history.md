HTML has been around since 1991, so there's been a fair bit of history and changes to the language. While I don't really touch on the history of the language in this course or quiz you about who first wrote it, the following links are provided for anyone who is interested in that sort of thing.

- [A Brief History of Markup](https://html5forwebdesigners.com/history/){% include optional.html %}
- [The Design Of HTML5](https://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/){% include optional.html %}

Both chapters are from the book [HTML5 For Web Designers](https://html5forwebdesigners.com/){% include optional.html %} (2010) by Jeremy Keith
