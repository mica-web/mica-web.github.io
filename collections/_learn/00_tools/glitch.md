## Introduction
[Glitch](https://glitch.com) is an online coding platform. By using Glitch, you'll be able to:
- see the immediate changes of your code in the browser
- share links to your demos and projects with your colleagues and me
- still use the tools this course typically depends on, like a text editor and GitHub
- and much more! 🎉

[This page](https://glitch.com/create) describes the power of Glitch in more detail.

## Getting Started

Go to the [sign in page](https://glitch.com/signin) and click **Create an account**.

You **do not** need to upgrade to premium. The free level of Glitch should work just fine for this purposes of this course.

Yay, you have a Glitch.com account 🙌🏻🌈

The instructions for week one will cover creating your first project and connecting Glitch to GitHub.
