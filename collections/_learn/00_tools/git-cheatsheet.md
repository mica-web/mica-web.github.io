Looking for a quick assist on a git issue?

* TOC
{: toc }

## Just give me a quick rundown

- `git status` to get details about your work, including your current branch name and details about any changes you've made
- `git add example.html` stages the changes from a single file (replace `example.html` with the actual filename)
- `git commit -m "Your message here"` will commit all the staged changes with the message you add between the double quotes (replacing "Your message here")
- `git push` will send all the changes you've committed to to your GitHub repo <span class="emoji">üéâ</span>

## What's going on with my project?
`git status`

This provides an output of information, including your current branch name and details about any changes you've made.

## I've created/added a new file, now what?
`git add example.html`

<span class="emoji">üôà</span> Remember to replace `example.html` with your actual filename

This stages the changes from a single file.

This is only one step in the git workflow, you still need to make a commit and push for your changes to show up on GitHub.

## I've made changes in more than one file and want to stage them.
`git add .`

This stages the changes from **all** your modified files.

<span class="emoji">‚ö†Ô∏è</span> You should not use this without first running `git status` to fully understand _which_ files git thinks have been modified. <span class="emoji">‚ö†Ô∏è</span>

{: .callout }
This is only one step in the git workflow, you still need to make a commit and push for your changes to show up on GitHub.

## The console says I have "changes to be committed."
`git commit -m "Your message here"`

<span class="emoji">üôà</span> Remember to replace `Your message here` with your actual commit message

This will make a commit of _all_ the staged changes with the message you add between the double quotes.

## My changes aren't showing up on GitHub!!

**First**, if you are working on a branch _other_ than your `master` branch, remember that GitHub defaults to the `master` branch.

You must use the branch name dropdown on your repo homepage to view the code and commits from the branch you are currently working on.

If that doesn't show you what you expect to see, **next** open up VS Code and the Glitch Console and run our familiar friend: `git status`

<span class="emoji">üëâüèª</span> Does it say your branch is ahead by any number of commits? If so: `git push` will send all the changes you've committed to to your GitHub repo.

{: .callout }
If you've attempted **both of these things** and you're still not seeing the same thing in Glitch _and_ GitHub, send me a DM via Slack, and we'll figure it out!
