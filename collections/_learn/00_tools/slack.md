# Slack

The course Slack will be our primary form of communication this semeseter.

All updates about the class, meeting links, Q&A about assignments, etc. -- the vast majority of Slack communication -- will happen via Slack.

ü§îThis isn't a change brought about by teaching online. Even in the semesters when my courses have met in person, we've used Slack.

## Getting started

1. Via email, you should have received an invite link to the class Slack. Use that to join.
  - Have any issues joining? Email me at [aweger@mica.edu](mailto:aweger@mica.edu) to get assistance.
1. Add your preferred name and a profile photo; as your professor, I have a strong preference for using an actual photo of your face for this account. üôèüèª
  - For any other accounts I ask you to sign up for, this is _not_ a requirement, but it really helps me in Slack.

You can use Slack in your web browser, as a desktop app and/or on mobile devices. I have no preference here -- do what works for you. What's important to me is that you see the notifications I post in Slack and participate. A couple of things you should do to make this possible:
1. By default, Slack notifies you for a variety of things; you can [configure the Slack notification settings](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000047906-Your-profile-preferences#adjust-your-notifications) to suit your needs.
1. You should also [make sure your time zone is properly set in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/219889247-Manage-your-time-zone-preferences)
1. Finally, you can turn off all notifictions either manually or by [setting a notification schedule](https://slack.com/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb). **I highly recommend** setting a default schedule so you don't get notifications at 2am.
  - Bonus: This means that if you send me a DM at 2am, I also won't see it until after my Do Not Disturb hours. üò¥

## Getting the most out of Slack
One of the many perks of Slack is that _everyone_ from the class is there -- that's so much better than just emailing me directly because your colleagues may have the same question or -- _so awesome_ -- may have the answer to your question. For this reason, I recommend that you default to posting in a channel (either **#general** or the channel for your course) if you have a question. You can always use `@Angelique` in your message to make sure I see it, even if you post it to a public channel.

üëâüèª There are, of course, times when it makes sense to DM me directly. Please DM me at any time and don't take the above to mean I don't want you to DM me.

There are some additional things you can learn to do in Slack that will help you get the most out of it.

1. **Format your messages.** Slack includes the ability to make text bold, italic or to make lists; [learn more](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages). Also, especially relevant for this course, you can [create and share code snippets](https://slack.com/help/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet) in Slack.
1. You can **add emoji reactions** to any message in Slack. [Learn how](https://slack.com/help/articles/206870317-Use-emoji-reactions). I especially appreciate a thumbs-up to class announcements so I know you've seen it. üëç
1. **Send DMs...to yourself.** You can make notes to yourself here. I use it to set myself reminders or save links I want to share to the class at certain times.
1. Speaking of reminders, **Slack has a built-in reminder system.** See the Slack Help Center for [instructions on creating reminders](https://slack.com/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder).

## Reminder
MICA's [guidelines for online etiquette (PDF, 102 KB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MR15B4UBGtdSwonED3IIu0igkUD5Sp3F/view) definitely apply to this space. Conversation may be casual (I definitely rely heavily on emoji and GIFs üòÅ), but it should always be appropriate and respectful.
