## Introduction
[GitHub](https://github.com) is a web site where you can store not just your code, but multiple versions of the same code. Additionally, GitHub allows other folks -- your colleagues and I -- to browse and review your code.

Unlike [Glitch](/learn/tools/glitch), GitHub doesn't make your code live and interactive -- which is why we need to use both. GitHub (or a very similar service) is commonly used by professional web development projects and open source projects, so it's definitely something you'll run into again if you decide to work in web development or collaborate with web developers.

## Getting Started
Go to the [GitHub homepage to sign up](https://github.com/).

You **do not** need to pay for your GitHub account. The free level will work just fine for this purposes of this course.
