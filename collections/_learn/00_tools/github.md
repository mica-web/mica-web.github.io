[GitHub](https://github.com) is a web site where you can store not just your code, but multiple versions of the same code. Additionally, GitHub allows other folks -- your colleagues and I -- to browse and review your code.

## Getting Started

Go to the [GitHub homepage to sign up](https://github.com/).

You **do not** need to pay for your GitHub account. The free level will work just fine for this purposes of this course.

Want to see detailed screenshots of the sign up process? [View this walkthrough on wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub).
