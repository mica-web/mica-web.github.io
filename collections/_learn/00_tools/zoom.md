All our sync-up meetings will be via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). You do **not** need to install anything to use Zoom, but the meeting security restrictions **will require you [sign up for a Zoom account](https://zoom.us/signup)**.

It's optional to [install the Zoom app](https://zoom.us/download), but it definitely offers a better experience, so I recommend doing so. If you're installing Zoom on your laptop or desktop computer, you want to download the **Zoom Client for Meetings**:

Alternately, you can also install Zoom on iOS and Android devices:

All our meetings will also be accessible via the [Zoom web client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214629443){% include optional.html %} which does **not** require you to install any additional software.

## Zoom meeting expectations
- When setting up your [Zoom profile](https://zoom.us/profile), please use your preferred name and a photo that matches your Slack account.
- I consider video to be <span class="emoji">ðŸ’¯</span> **optional** during our class meetings; I know not everyone has the bandwidth or the comfort to be on video.
- Video, audio and Zoom chat are all valid ways to participate in our meetings; please use whichever is comfortable for you.
- I also encourage you to get familiar with and use Zoom's [nonverbal feedback icons](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183#h_50523139-7bac-403b-9c59-1755ada65ad9) (see the section under **Providing nonverbal feedback during meetings (participants)**).

- As with [Slack]({{ lp | append: 'slack' }}), MICA's [guidelines for online etiquette (PDF, 102 KB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MR15B4UBGtdSwonED3IIu0igkUD5Sp3F/view) apply to our communications via Zoom.

### Additional audio recommendations
If you're likely to want to use audio during our meetings, keep the following in mind:

- Please try to join our meetings from a quiet location.
- If you are not talking, please turn off your mic/mute yourself.
- If possible, use set of headphones with an inline mic; while Zoom works with the built-in microphone in many laptops, that also tends to pick up the sound of your computer fans and typing, too.

<span class="emoji">ðŸ’¡</span> Are there Zoom strategies used by other professors that you'd recommend for this class? Let me know! While I use Zoom **a lot** for work and other professional meetings, you're the expert about using it in a classroom or educational setting. Let me know what works; I welcome your suggestions via Slack of the **open an issue link** below.
