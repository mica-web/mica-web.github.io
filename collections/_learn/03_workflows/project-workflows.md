There are many ways that folks go about working in teams to create software, but two common approaches are <b>waterfall</b> and <b>agile</b>. This brief video defines and compares both approaches:

Most of your work to date probably closely resembles a waterfall approach. As the video above concludes, both approaches have their place and which you should use can depend on many factors, such as the team size and the project scope.

While I have used a waterfall approach for client work and some small-scale projects, all of my web product experience has involved some variation of the agile approach.

If you have questions about these approaches, feel free to ask them in the <b>#general</b> channel.
