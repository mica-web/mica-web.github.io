Deliverables for web design can take many forms:

## Wireframes
Wireframes are low-fidelity examples that sketch out the structure of a web page.

{: .u-list-reset.image-wrapper }
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'wireframes1.jpg' }})
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'wireframes2.jpg' }})
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'wireframes3.jpg' }})

While fast to create and update, wireframes are often too abstract for clients to review or respond to.

## Comps
Comps or mock-ups are high-fidelity and seek to create a detailed example of what a web site will look like once its built. It's common to create multiple comps for a web project -- not just for individual pages, but also for each page at different device/screen sizes.

{: .u-list-reset.image-wrapper }
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'comps3.gif' }})
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'comps2.png' }})
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'comps1.jpg' }})

While easily understood by clients (and even interactive, depending on your tools), comps are a heckin' lot of work, especially if you're still iterating on your design _and_ are providing multiple layouts.

## Style tiles -- Just right!

{: .text-center }
![]({{ ip | append: 'styletiles.png' }})

Style tiles are a tool that live in the middle space between wireframes and comps, like a mood board for the final site design. They provide an overview of some of the design elements of a site or page (like the colors, typography, button designs and icon possibilities), without going so far as to resolve how the _whole_ site is going to look.

{: .u-list-reset.image-wrapper }
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'styletile3.png' }})
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'styletile2.png' }})
- ![]({{ ip | append: 'styletile1.jpg' }})
