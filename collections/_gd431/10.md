## Homework

Begin work on one of the following for your site redesign:
- An interior page with a form on it
  - This must be a form that's more complex than a search form, a subscription form or a basic contact-us form
- A page with an interactive element on it
  - Other than the mobile menu we created in class
- (Re)designed search results page
  - Should demo search results and include pagination for at least three pages of results
  - If your site does not have search, reach out to me to discuss your options here!
- either a 404 error page or a branded smartwatch notification
  - in the case of the smartwatch notification, this can be design only (ie, you can turn in an image file vs markup)

Commit to what you're working on next in your project Slack channel. Like the homepage, this new page should be mobile-first and responsive (exception: smartwatch notification).

Create a pull request to get feedback on your project's organization and code before November 19. In the pull request description, include what you've done to date and what work remains to be done and any bits that you specifically want or need feedback on. You can also do this in your code by creating a comment that starts with @feedback, e.g.:

**In HTML**
```html
<!-- @feedback Is it right to use an ordered list here? -->
<!--
```
**In Sass or JS**
```scss
// @feedback I'm using vw units here, but it is confusing. Do you have a better suggestion?
```
-->
