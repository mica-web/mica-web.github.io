## Agenda

- Slack Q&A
- Discuss reading on [priority guides](https://alistapart.com/article/priority-guides-a-content-first-alternative-to-wireframes)
- Share & compare priority guides
- HTML best practices
- Convert resume text into HTML; organized per your priority guide
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) tips & tricks
- Intro to [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)

## Homework

- Add styles to your resume
  - Use CodePen for this
  - Comment your CSS a lot a lot a lot: What did you struggle with? What didn't you achieve? What did you try? How would you like this to look on a phone?
  - The styles _do not_ need to match your current resume. They can, if you like, but I _will not_ be evaluating your CSS or your designs based on how closely they match your existing resume.
- Watch the following videos from Jen Simmons Layout Land channel:
  - [Innovative & Practical Graphic Design with CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hmOZU7Zk10)
  - [CSS Grid like you are Jan Tschichold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxrsO4aIjyc)
  - You don't have to learn her techniques, per se, but this is meant to be a taster for what's coming in terms of CSS layout
