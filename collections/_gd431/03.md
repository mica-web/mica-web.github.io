## Homework

Continue to work on your resume. The priority this week should be:
- writing semantic markup
- putting into use the HTML & CSS best practices you've learned in class
- writing BEM-style class names
  - I would also challenge you to write class names for most of your base elements (except the `body`); while this may be overdoing things for a simple one-page resume, it serves as an impetus to write BEM class names and prove your understanding of this naming strategy

Read the following:
- [Getting Started With CSS Layout](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/guide-css-layout/)
- [New CSS Features That Are Changing Web Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/future-of-web-design/)

For our discussion, please have a response to each of the readings and to the [W2 homework](#week02) YouTube videos. Your response could be:
- a **quote** that stood out to you
- a **comment** that you have in response to something you learned, something you (dis)agreed with, something that surprised you
- a **question** raised or something that you found confusing

- Identify possible posters to emulate in CSS and make responsive:
  - three possibilities of interesting designs to recreate
  - plus one "stretch" example

For each example, have the following:
- a direct link to the poster image
- the date
- the poster's creator or producer
