## Activities

{: .callout }
This section outlines things you will do outside of our synced up time and before the next class meeting.

<span class="emoji">ðŸ’¡</span> Because the readings provide important context for the activities, I recommend doing the following in order.

Please complete the following by the end of the day (in your timezone) 9/4:
- Follow [the instructions]({{ wp | append: 'slack'}}) to join the class Slack, if you haven't done so already
- Complete the [intro survey](https://forms.gle/xfWYDSjiP5mgJwnPA){:target="_blank"}

Please complete the following before our next sync up:
- Learn a little bit about a lot of things:
    - [web browsers]({{ lp | append: 'tools/browsers' }}) (and download one of the recommended browsers)
    - the tools we'll be using throughout the course and create accounts there:
        - [Glitch]({{ lp | append: 'tools/glitch' }})
        - [GitHub]({{ lp | append: 'tools/github' }})
        - [text editors]({{ lp | append: 'tools/text-editors' }}) + [VS Code]({{ lp | append: 'tools/vs-code' }})
- If git and GitHub are new to you, read this [introduction to git]({{ wp | append: 'git' }})
- Get your new Glitch and GitHub accounts talking to each other; [learn how]({{ lp | append: 'workflows/glitch-and-github' }})
