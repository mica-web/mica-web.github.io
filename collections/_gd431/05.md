## Homework

Continue to work on your poster design -- but from now on in VS Code
- Add media queries to make your poster responsive
  - Ideally, it should display well from 360px to 1680px 
- Make regular commits via git (moar commits is better)
- If you want feedback before Thursday, make sure to `git push` to your homework branch so you can share your current work with me via DM on Slack
