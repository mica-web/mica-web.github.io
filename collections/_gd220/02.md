<!-- ## Homework
- Add [this text](https://gist.github.com/angeliquejw/a4279c23d1e49d2b5dfadc54b45dcce3) to your `index.html` and mark up the text using the elements you've learned so far.
    - Remember that you're focusing on the structure and meaning behind your HTML choices right now; the browser is going to apply some default formatting and, for now, you should just roll with it and not try to control the styling of your text.
    - If you have questions or doubts about any of your code, remember that you can leave me notes using [HTML comments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#HTML_comments).

- Before our next meeting, read [Conversations with Robots: Voice, Smart Agents & the Case for Structured Content](https://alistapart.com/article/conversations-with-robots).
    - Bring your **questions**, **quotes**, and **comments/insights** from the reading to class.

## Resources
Looking to expand your HTML knowledge? The [HTML MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) are a great resource for understanding HTML elements.

Want a refresher on the git workflow? I've created [this step-by-step guide with screenshots]({% link gd-220/hints/git-workflow.md %}). -->
