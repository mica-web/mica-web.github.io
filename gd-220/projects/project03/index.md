# {{page.title }}: One-page Event Site

## In Brief
You will design a one-page web site advertising an upcoming design conference.

## Purpose
Use your current knowledge of HTML and CSS, respectively, to:
- Structure and organize an entire web page
- Create a layout that adapts to a variety of device/browser sizes

</header>

<section>

## Process
1. Create a document outlining the [content for your conference website]({% link gd-220/projects/project03/research.md %}).
1. Follow [the instructions for the design phase]({% link gd-220/projects/project03/design.md %}) of the project.
1. Follow the [setup instructions]({% link gd-220/projects/project03/setup.md %}).
1. Create your pull request.
1. In the HTML file and on the branch you created in the previous step, write the markup your event content.
  - Do **not** add class names or extra `div` or `span` elements at this point. The simplest markup is the best markup at this point.
  - Your markup should **not** try to predict the future needs of your layout; it _should_ describe your content semantically.
1. When you are ready for your markup to be reviewed, send me a link to to your pull request via Slack DM.
1. Create mobile-first styles for your design.
1. Write media queries to make your site responsive.
1. Present project to colleagues.

## Submission
1. Create a [pull request]({% link _learn/03_workflows/pull-request.md %}) for code review and final submission.
  - Include [PR template questions]({% link gd-220/projects/project03/pr-template.md %}) and your responses.
1. Send me a link to the pull request via Slack DM by midnight EST on 12/18 ([see in your timezone](https://everytimezone.com/s/82b9cccb){:target="_blank"}).


## Requirements
- The design should be responsive, working on mobile devices as small as px wide and other devices up to 1280px wide.
- The site _must_ be a one-page site. Do **not** create individual pages for any required or additional content.
- The design must include:
  - Event name
  - In-page navigation
  - Event schedule
  - Details for at least three talks (including talk name and description)
  - Three speaker bios (including a photo)
  - Call to action and link to buy tickets
- Your code _must_ include:
  - The following HTML elements: `header`, `main`, `footer`, `h1`, `img`, `a`
  - At least two media queries
  - At least two CSS variables
- Your CSS _must_ be written mobile first.
- The content for your speaker bios and talk descriptions does _not_ need to be original. You may use content from an existing event, but you must document the source(s) in your PR description.
- As always, you must document all the resources used in your final design, including text/copy, images, fonts, patterns, etc; you can provide a detailed list as part of your PR description.
- ðŸ’¡As this is your final project for the semester, this should be a summary of what you have learned to date about designing for the web, including: writing HTML and CSS according to best practices, your knowledge of CSS layout, incorporating animation/interactivity in your designs, utilizing CSS variables, etc.
