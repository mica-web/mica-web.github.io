This video goes through each of the steps pretty quickly. If you want more detail about the steps, consider revisiting the [initial walkthrough](https://loom.com/share/folder/779298f8d2a9447e9d2030228720b72a){:target="_blank"}. -->

1. Follow the [instructions to connect Glitch and GitHub]({% link _learn/03_workflows/glitch-and-github.md %}), using the following details:
  - Remix [this Glitch project](https://glitch.com/~mica-web-starter).
  - Create a new GitHub repo named "project3".
1. Before starting to write any HTML, you must first [create a branch]({% link _learn/03_workflows/branching.md %}) off the master branch. Name your new branch <b>event</b>.
1. After you've created your new branch and are working on the <b>event</b> branch, add a new file named <b>index.html</b>
1. Open the new <b>index.html</b> and, in your text editor, type an exclamation mark `!` and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
  - This shortcut should create the default structure for your HTML document.
  - If, for whatever reason, this does not work for you, you can instead copy the HTML from [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/angeliquejw/cf4f8dec09092103c0b7a75daa75a7a0/raw/a94fec4a8c121ffd2d65cd3a0fcef1bec25c7f44/index.html){:target="_blank"} and paste it into your `index.html` file.
1. Create a new file named <b>styles.css</b> and create a link to it inside of your `index.html` file.
1. Stage your changes to both files and make a commit (example commit message: "Starting project 3")
1. Push your changes up to GitHub: `git push -u gh event`
  - You should now see a matching copy of your HTML and CSS in your GitHub repo and on the Glitch project page. 🙌🏻🌈😺
