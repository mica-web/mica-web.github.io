# {{page.title }}
Think about the conference from a potential attendee's POV. What info do they want to know? What info is most crucial? Consider how the event info should be broken up into sections and how users will navigate within the page.

1. Sketch 3 layout options for mobile and desktop _each_. These sketches do not need to be polished -- they are an exploration of the different ways you can organize the information for your project.
1. Create a single mobile comp based on the layout you would like to build.
  - Remember to include hover styles in your comps or other interactions.
1. Create a sketch or wireframe to describe how your layout will adapt on desktop devices. This should be simple and basic -- you do **not** need to create a full comp for desktop unless you choose to do so.

## Submitting your designs
1. Please thoughtfully name your files so I know what I'm looking at.
1. Please only provide flat image files of your sketches and designs (example: PDF, PNG, JPG).
1. Inside our {% include gd220-drive.md %}, there is a folder titled <b>project04</b> and _inside_ the <b>project04</b> folder is a folder with your name. Please add all your documents to your personal folder.
