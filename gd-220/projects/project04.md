# {{page.title }}: One-page Event Site

## In Brief
You will design a one-page web site advertising an upcoming design conference.

## Purpose
@TBD

</header>

<section>

## Process
1. Complete a written [competitor analysis](#competitor-analysis).
1. Come up with a unique theme for your event. What do you think is the most important issue in the design field today?
1. Create a Google doc for your conference content:
  - Conference name
  - Location
  - Dates
  - Name and bios for 3 speakers
1. Think about the conference from a potential attendee's POV. What info do they want to know? What info is most crucial?
1. Consider how the event info should be broken up into sections and how users will navigate within the page.
1. Sketch 3 layout options for mobile and desktop _each_.
1. Create a mobile comp based on the final style tile and layout. Remember to include hover effects in your comps. Additionally, create a responsive wireframe to explain how your layout will appear on larger screens.
1. Create a "project4" branch and a new directory ("project4") in your course projects directory.
1. Create markup for the modular elements in your design. Make a pull request for this work.
1. Create the markup for your entire page.
1. Translate your design into mobile-first styles.
1. Update your pull request for final submission.
1. Present your project to the class.

## Requirements
- The design should be responsive, working on mobile devices as small as 375px wide and other devices up to 1280px wide.
- The site _must_ be a one-page site. Do not create individual pages for any required or additional content.
- The design must include:
  - Event name
  - In-page navigation
  - Event schedule
  - Details for at least three talks (including talk name and description)
  - Three speaker bios (including a photo)
  - Call to action and link to buy tickets
- Your code _must_ include:
  - The following HTML elements: `header`, `main`, `footer`, `h1`, `img`, `a`
  - At least two media queries
  - At least two CSS variables
- Your CSS _must_ be written mobile first.
- The content for your speaker bios and talk descriptions does _not_ need to be original. You may use content from an existing event, but you must document the source in an HTML comment in each instance.
- As always, you must document all the resources used in your final design, including text/copy, images, fonts, patterns, etc. You can do this either in an HTML comment at the end of your HTML file or in your PR description.
- ðŸ’¡As this is your final project for the semester, this should be a summary of what you have learned to date about designing for the web, including: writing HTML and CSS according to best practices, your knowledge of CSS layout, incorporating animation/interactivity in your designs, utilizing CSS variables, etc.

## Competitor Analysis
Identify **2 existing conferences** with an art/design/tech focus, then document and analyze the event web sites. Your analysis should be ~3 pages and include the following:

### For _each_ conference:
  - Event name
  - Year of the event
  - URL of the event web site
  - 4 screenshots:
    - homepage @ 375px and 1280px
    - either the list of speakers or the list of talks @ 375px and 1280px
  - Written analysis of the site design, including strengths and weaknesses (~0.5 page per event).


### Conclusion
Write a ~1 paragraph **summary** of your main takeaways from this analysis, bringing together what you learned across all three events.

### Submitting your competitor analysis
Add your document to the [Project 4 Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/11BqHx7wEOcq8eTKM_2WdC0gjGqAeekTS), following the instructions in the README.
