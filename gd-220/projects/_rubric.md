Grading
-------

Projects are graded on a traditional scale of 0-100 against a rubric ([see example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTwhxDx3oZco1CQLtyOhTPnaZ4aAIzSXt62AbhiQLHlvYesx649B08L1XfLbVoRkCenMPsAkfFy2MfW/pubhtml?gid=1528571283&single=true){:target="_blank"}) which is shared at project kickoff. Detailed feedback will be provided for each project via GitHub review.
