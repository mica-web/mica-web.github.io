# {{page.title }}: Card Component

## In Brief
You will design a card component and then recreate that design using your current knowledge of HTML and CSS, as well as any media (e.g., images, icons) you choose.

## Purpose
- Recognize and resolve the issues of interpreting a static design into an adaptable, functional web component.
- Demonstrate your understanding of basic HTML and CSS, including basic layout styles.

## Process
1. Review options for the [type of card]({% link gd-220/projects/project02/card-options.md %}) you may design.
  - Even though you're not designing a whole site, you should think about the context for your card: What type of site does it exist on? Who is the audience for this site?
1. Create **two** [style tiles]({% link _learn/03_workflows/style-tiles.md %}) with your ideas about typography and colors for this assignment, including the following:
  - color palette
  - body text styling
  - button design
1. Using the design program of your choosing, create **two** different design comps for your card component based on the elements from your style tiles.
1. Present style tiles and concepts to classmates for critique.
    - Upload your style tiles and designs to {% include gd431-drive.md %}
    - Only upload PDFs, PNGs or JPGS please <span class="emoji">üôèüèª</span>
1. Follow the [setup instructions]({% link gd-220/projects/project02/setup.md %})
1. Create your pull request.
1. In the HTML file and on the branch you created in the previous step, write the markup for a **single** card.
1. After deciding on your style direction, write CSS based on your comps and style tiles.
1. Present project to colleagues.

## Submission
1. Create a [pull request]({% link _learn/03_workflows/pull-request.md %}) for code review and final submission.
  - Include [PR template questions]({% link gd-220/projects/project02/pr-template.md %}) and your responses.
1. Send me a link to the pull request via Slack DM by midnight EST on 10/30 ([see in your timezone](https://everytimezone.com/s/a2745de7){:target="_blank"}).

## Requirements
- Your design can have a maximum width of 640 pixels.
- All designs, regardless of card type, should include the following:
  - Title
