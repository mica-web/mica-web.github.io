- Demonstrate your understanding of basic HTML and CSS, including basic layout styles.

## Process
1. Review options for the [type of card]({% link gd-220/projects/project02/card-options.md %}) you may design.

  - color palette
  - body text styling
  - button design
1. Using the design program of your choosing, create **two** different design comps for your card component based on the elements from your style tiles.
1. Present style tiles and concepts to classmates for critique.
1. Follow the [setup instructions]({% link gd-220/projects/project02/setup.md %})
1. In the HTML file and on the branch you created in the previous step, write the markup for a single card.
1. After deciding on your style direction, write CSS based on your comps and style tiles.
1. Present project to colleagues.

## Submission
