**Purpose:** This week's readings introduce some of the complexity when designing web forms and making sure our designs and code work for the widest possible audience.

There are two possible readings this week:
- [Creating More Inclusive and Culturally Sensitive Forms](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/creating-more-inclusive-and-culturally-sensitive-forms/){% include estimate.html time=7 %} -- Mark Anbinder writes about cultural expectations and norms around the name field in web forms.
- [Styling Forms Accessibly](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/styling-forms-accessibly/){% include estimate.html time=9 %} -- Amanda Cheung writes about accessibility and usability of web forms.

Choose **one** of the above readings and, after you've read it, share back in the <b>#gd2</b> Slack channel:
- Which article you read
- One thing you learned or had not previously considered
- An experience with a web form that frustrated you
