2. Select the changes you want to stage by clicking the plus sign next to each file or, if you want to stage all changes, next to the "Changes" header. Note that these symbols only appear after you hover over the header or hover over or select the filenames.

6. You can verify your changes either by looking at the pull request on GitHub or looking at the code on GitHub (to do this, remember you may need to switch branches in the GitHub UI).
