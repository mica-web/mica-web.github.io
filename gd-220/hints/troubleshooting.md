Troubleshooting your code
=========================

<span class="text-larger emoji"> 🕵🏻‍♂️</span> **In your browser, use dev tools to explore the problem**

  - Does the HTML structure look wonky? You may be missing a closing tag somewhere.
  - In the CSS explorer, is a declaration unexpectedly marked out? This means the code is either broken or is being overwritten by another declaration.

<span class="text-larger emoji">🔲</span> **Isolate the problem by commenting out code that you think is unrelated**

<span class="text-larger emoji">🧹</span> **Clean up/organize your code**

  - Make sure you have proper indentation; this makes it easier to find missing closing tags in HTML or closing brackets in CSS.
  - Alphabetize your CSS properties; this makes it easier to spot if you have written a rule that is overriding another;

<span class="text-larger emoji">◻️</span> **Start fresh; create a CodePen and retype the code you think is creating the problem.**

  - Don't copy and paste, as that would negate the purpose. This is a fine way to catch misspellings or missed elements, like a unit or bracket.

<span class="text-larger emoji">👀</span> **Ask someone else to look at your code (ideally, either on GitHub or isolated in a CodePen so they can muck around a bit)**

  - Their fresh set of eyes may catch something you've glanced over.
  - Your colleague may understand a specific bit of code better than you do (e.g., they may know that a value is invalid for the property you're using).

<span class="text-larger emoji">🔍</span> **Review your code for:**

  - misspelled properties, elements or classnames
  - missing brackets or semicolons
  - spaces between numbers and units (e.g., `width: 20 px;`)
  - missing hyphens in properties or classnames

<span class="text-larger emoji">💡</span> **Take a break**

  - Exhaustion and mounting frustraton do not make for clearheaded troubleshooting
  - I know this is hard to accept when it's an hour before something is due, so try to give yourself plenty of time to comlete assignments

<span class="text-larger emoji">💾</span> **Catch mistakes earlier by saving early, saving often and verifying your changes in the browser**
