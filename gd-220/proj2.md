# Project 2: Card Specimen

You will design the layout for a card/tile component and create the design using HTML, CSS and any media (e.g., images, icons) you choose to incorporate. Your design should take into consideration that this component will be repeated in a page layout.

## Process
1. Review options for the [type of card](#additional-requirements-based-on-card-type) you may design.
1. Create **two** [style tiles](https://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work) with your ideas about typography and colors for this assignment, including the following: color palette, body text, and two other components of your card.
1. Using Sketch or a similar program, create **two** different design comps for your card component based on the elements from your style tiles.
1. Present style tiles and concepts to classmates for critique.
1. Using your final design choice, create a new comp that shows 3-4 cards in a layout together. You do **not** need to design the rest of the site layout (i.e., this comp does not need a site logo or navigation), just a background color and how the cards would be laid out in relationship to one another. You **do** need to use different info for your card designs in this comp (i.e., if you're doing a movie card design, it needs to be the same style of card, but show info for 3-4 different movies).
1. Create a new git branch and a new directory ("project2") in your course projects directory and, within this directory, create a new `index.html`. Create the markup for a single card. Create a pull request for this work.
1. After deciding on your style direction, write CSS based on your comps and style tiles.
1. Update your pull request for final submission. (NOTE: While your comps consider multiple versions of a single card design, your code version should only be of a single card.)

## Considerations
- audience
- readability
- legibility

## Requirements
- Your design can have a maximum width of 640 pixels.
- All designs, regardless of card type, should include the following:
