# Project 2: Card Specimen

You will design the layout for a card/tile component and create the design using HTML, CSS and any media (e.g., images, icons) you choose to incorporate. Your design should take into consideration that this component will be repeated in a page layout.

## Process
1. Review options for the [type of card](#additional-requirements-based-on-card-type) you may design.
1. Create two [style tiles](https://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work) with your ideas about typography and colors for this assignment, including the following: color palette, body text, and two other components of your card.
1. Using Sketch or a similar program, create two possible design comps for your card component using the elements from your style tiles. Your concept sketches should include how multiple versions of the card would look in a single layout (e.g., multiple recipes on a single page).
1. Create a new branch and a new directory ("project2") in your course projects directory and, within this directory, create the markup for a single card. Create a pull request for this work.
1. After deciding on your style direction, write CSS based on your comps and style tiles.
1. Present style tiles and concepts. Checkin and feedback on styles in class.
1. Update your pull request for final submission. (NOTE: While your comps consider multiple versions of a single card design, your code version should only be of a single card.)

## Considerations
- audience
- readability
- legibility
- hierarchy
- contrast
- repetition

## Requirements
- Your design can have a maximum width of 640 pixels.
- All designs, regardless of card type, should include the following:
  - Title
  - Image
- You must document all the resources used in your final design, including images, fonts, patterns, etc. You can do this either in an HTML comment at the end of your HTML file or in CSS comments inside your stylesheet.
