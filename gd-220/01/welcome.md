<span class="text-larger emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span> Welcome to Graphic Design 2! Together, you're going to learn how to take your current skills and knowledge and apply them to the web.

This class will be <span class="text-larger emoji">ðŸ’¯</span> online and mainly asynchronous -- which means you'll work through the course content and exercises on your own schedule on a weekly basis. We'll hold synchronous meetings to review your work, discuss readings and troubleshoot your code.

Your weekly course materials will include sections for what we'll cover during those sync-up times, as well as tasks for you to complete throughout the week, like readings and coding demos.

For the purposes of our schedule, the async materials listed in each week should be completed _before_ our next meeting -- so, the following materials should be completed before _next_ Thursday and are _not_ expected to be done before the first class meeting.
