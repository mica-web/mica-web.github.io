<span class="text-larger emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span> Welcome to Graphic Design 2! Together, you're going to learn how to take your current skills and knowledge and apply them to the web.

This class will be <span class="emoji">ðŸ’¯</span> online and mainly asynchronous -- which means you'll work through the course content and exercises on your own schedule on a weekly basis. We'll hold synchronous meetings to review your work, discuss readings and troubleshoot your code.

Your weekly course materials will include the following sections
- **intro**: my overview of what we're covering this week, why it matters and how it can help you
- **sync up**: what we'll plan to do during our synchronous meeting
- **activities**: what you should work on during the week (for example, readings, coding demos) and complete before the _next_ class meeting

So, for example, the activities for this week -- week one -- should be completed before _next_ Thursday and are _not_ expected to be done before the first class meeting.

Even if the class does not meet in a given week, <span class="highlighter--simple">the activities should be completed on schedule</span> unless we explicitly discuss otherwise.
