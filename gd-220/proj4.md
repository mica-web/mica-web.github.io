You will design a one-page web site advertising an upcoming design conference. The final project will be usable by mobile devices as small as 375px wide and desktop monitors as large as 1280px wide.

## Process
1. Come up with a unique theme for your event. What do you think is the most important issue in the design field today?
1. Determine event details, such as the conference name, location and date(s).
1. Identify three speakers for the event and document your initial research to use in creating content for the site.
1. Complete a competitor analysis: Identify 3 existing conferences with an art/design/tech focus and document and analyze their event web site. Your analysis should be ~5 pages and include the following:
  - Event name, year of the event and the URL of the web site
  - 1 page of screenshots: Take screenshots at 2 widths (375px and 1280px) of the homepage and either the list of speakers or talks (total of 4 screenshots).
  - Written analysis of the site design, including strengths and weaknesses (~0.5 page per event).
  - A summary of your main takeaways from this analysis (~ 1 paragraph).
1. Think about the conference from a potential attendee's POV. What info do they want to know? What info is most crucial?
1. Consider how the event info should be broken up into sections and how users will navigate within the page.
1. Skech 2-3 designs for your event site and choose one to make mobile and desktop comps for in Sketch or a similar program.
1. Create a "project4" branch and a new directory ("project4") in your course projects directory and, within this directory, create the markup for your event site. Create a pull request for this work.
1. Translate your design into mobile-first styles.
1. Update your pull request for final submission.
1. Present your project to the class.

## Considerations
- audience
- hierarchy
- wayfinding
- readability
- legibility
- contrast
- chunking

## Requirements
- The design should be responsive, working on mobile devices as small as 375px wide and other devices up to 1280px wide.
- The design must include:
  - Event name
  - In-page navigation
  - Event schedule
  - Details for at least three talks (including talk name and description)
  - Three speaker bios (including a photo)
  - Call to action and link to buy tickets
- Your code **must** include:
  - The following HTML elements: `header`, `main`, `footer`, `h1`, `img`, `a`
  - At least one media query
  - At least two CSS variables
- The content for your speaker bios and talk descriptions does **not** need to be original. You may use content from an existing event, but you must document the source in an HTML comment in each instance.
- As always, you must document all the resources used in your final design, including text/copy, images, fonts, patterns, etc. You can do this either in an HTML comment at the end of your HTML file or in your PR description.
- ðŸ’¡As this is your final project for the semester, this should be a summary of what you have learned to date about designing for the web, including: writing HTML and CSS according to best practices, your knowledge of CSS layout, incorporating animation/interactivity in your designs, utilizing CSS variables, etc.
