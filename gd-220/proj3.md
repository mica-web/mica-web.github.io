# Project 3: Timeline

You will create content documenting a day in your life and design a timeline to display it.

This project will take into consideration storytelling and the passage of time as an in-browser designed experience. The impact and usefulness of interaction, such as hover effects and scrolling, will be demonstrated. The final project will be usable by mobile devices as small as 375px wide and desktop monitors as large as 1280px wide.

## Process
1. Gather the content for your timeline:
  - Photos: Take a photo for every hour that you are awake during the day you are documenting. The image should be descriptive of where you are or what you are doing at that time.
  - Text:  Write captions to go along with your photos. Captions should be 2-3 sentences long and at least two captions should be significantly more descriptive and at least two paragraphs long.
1. Skech 2-3 designs for your timeline and choose one to make mobile (375px wide) and desktop (1280px wide) comps for in Sketch or a similar program.
1. Create a new branch ("project3") based on your master branch. Switch to the new branch.
1. Create a new directory ("project3") in your course projects directory and, within this directory, create the markup for your timeline. Create a pull request for this work.
1. Translate your design into mobile-first styles.
1. Update your pull request for final submission.
1. Present your project to the class.

## Considerations
- hierarchy
- interaction, flow, movement
- readability
- legibility
- chunking
- balance
- repetition

## Requirements
- The design should be responsive, working on mobile devices as small as 375px wide and other devices up to 1280px wide.
- The design must include a heading for the overall timeline.
- For each hour of the day that you document, you should include the following:
  - A demarcation of the time being documented
  - A photo and related caption
    - The majority of your captions should be 2-3 sentences long.
    - At least two captions must be two paragraphs in length.
- All content (photographs, text, any other supporting graphics) must be your own.
