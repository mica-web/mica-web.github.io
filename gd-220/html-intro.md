Hope you're all safe and warm and out of the weather. Since we can't meet today, I thought I'd prepare this basic introduction to HTML, including a few activities, to get things under way.

**HTML** stands for "Hypertext Markup Language," and it provides structure and meaning to the content of web pages.

Read the following pages and complete **all** active learning exercises described in 'em:

- [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
- [HTML text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals)
- [Creating hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)
- [Advanced text formatting: Quotations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting#Quotations) -- _Note:_ all the other links in this list are to whole sections of the Introduction to HTML. This is just a single section of a much larger unit, and you can stop when you end Quotations and get to Abbreviations.

## Active learning exercises

Please put your solutions for the following active learning exercises in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and send a link to **each exercise** to me via DM on Slack:
