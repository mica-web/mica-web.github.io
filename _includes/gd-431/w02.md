1. Add styles to your resume
  - Use CodePen for this
  - Comment your CSS a lot a lot a lot: What did you struggle with? What didn't you achieve? What did you try? How would you like this to look on a phone?
  - The styles **do not** need to match your current resume. They can, if you like, but I **will not** be evaluating your CSS or your designs based on how closely they match your existing resume.
1. Watch the following videos from Jen Simmons Layout Land channel:
  - [Innovative & Practical Graphic Design with CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hmOZU7Zk10)
  - [CSS Grid like you are Jan Tschichold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxrsO4aIjyc)
  - You don't have to learn her techniques, per se, but this is meant to be a taster for what's coming in terms of CSS layout
