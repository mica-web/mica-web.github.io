Homework
</div>

Continue to work on your resume. The priority this week should be:
- writing semantic markup
- putting into use the HTML & CSS best practices you've learned in class
- writing BEM-style class names
  - I would also challenge you to write class names for most of your base elements (except the `body`); while this may be overdoing things for a simple one-page resume, it serves as an impetus to write BEM class names and prove your understanding of this naming strategy
