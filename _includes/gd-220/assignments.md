### When Developing
- Write your code in Visual Studio Code (or another text editor with plugins to lint and format your code)
- View and do initial testing in Chrome
- Do not rely on a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation); you should  be writing your own styles and systems, not relying on someone else's

### Citing Work


### In Production
- All projects will be responsive and look good on mobile, tablet and desktop devices
