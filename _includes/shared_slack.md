- Read [this introduction to using Slack](/learn/tools/slack)
- Look in your email for a welcome note from me, including an invite to the class Slack, and join up

  - your pronouns
  - if you're new to MICA
  - which class you're taking (the Slack is shared by GD2 and GD431 students)
  - something you like to do
  - something you like to eat
