## Format
This class will be <span class="emoji">ðŸ’¯</span> online and mainly asynchronous -- which means you'll work through the course content and exercises on your own schedule on a weekly basis. We'll hold synchronous meetings to review your work, discuss readings, troubleshoot your code and anything else that feels valuable to do together synchronously.

To double down on what I wrote in the syllabus: **This does _not_ mean you're on your own!** You'll be connected to your colleagues and me via Slack, and I will provide a variety of opportunities to connect via Zoom.

Your weekly course materials will include the following sections
- **intro**: my overview of what we're covering this week, why it matters and how it can help you
- **sync up**: what we'll plan to do during our synchronous meeting
- **activities**: what you should work on during the week (for example, readings, coding demos) and complete before the _next_ class meeting

So, for example, the activities for this week -- week one -- should be completed before _next_ Thursday and are _not_ expected to be done before the first class meeting.

Even if the class does not meet in a given week, <span class="highlighter--simple">the activities should be completed on schedule</span> unless we explicitly discuss otherwise.

ðŸ¤” I know this might be a bit confusing. If there's a way to make it clearer, let me know!

## Week one details
This week, we have two priorities:

1. Have a shared understanding of the goals of this course, discuss the format of the course, and make sure you know what it takes to be successful in the course.
2. Get you sorted with the tools we'll use throughout the semester.

Week one is going to start off with some pretty solid technical challenges -- but know that I've guided several classes through this in the past and we've always been able to troubleshoot any issues that have come up. Also, the tools you're being introduced to are ones you'll use for every project this semester -- so, what might feel challenging or confusing in week one will be routine by week 16 (and even earlier).
